Description

Simplify square roots in the form (a sqrt(b))/(c sqrt(d)). A simplified radical should have no square roots in the denominator and no number in a square root should have a square factor. For example, the input 2 5 5 10 for a b c d, respectively, should simplify to 1 2 5 where a=1, b=2, and c=5.

 a b c
(d should not exist after simplifying)
